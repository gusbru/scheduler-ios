# Scheduler App

## Introduction

The Schedule App was designed to help students to find sections in the Langara Courses.

## 1. Clone and Open The Project

To install the application locally, first clone the source code

```
git clone git@github.com:gusbru/scheduler-ios.git
```

Then, open the `Scheduler.xcodeproj` using Xcode. The app was developed using Xcode 11.4 with Swift 5.1.

## 2. Install

After opening the project, select a device that the app will run. Both a virtual or a real device can be chosen. Once a device is selected, click the
`run` button and wait until the app launches. 

## 3. Using

When first launch the app, a login screen will appear. It is possible to choose login or sign in (create a new user). It is possible to use 
a test user (user: `user1@test` / password: `password`) or create a new one.

After the login step, first, select the desired `Term`. Each term has different subjects. Once the `Term` is selected, select the desired
`Subject`. With both `Term` and `Subject` selected, click the search button. 

The search result displays all the available sections for the current selection.
